## Introduction
This is a dashboard application that helps users and interested parties visualize Vancouver crime data, publicly released by the Vancouver Police Department ([VPD](https://vpd.ca/)). The information will be arranged in a manner that takes into account the different types of criminal behavior, as well as the time periods and neighbourhoods involved. It is important to note that the purpose of this dashboard is not to label any specific area of Vancouver with a negative connotation, but rather to educate. For a detailed description of the motivation, description, and usage scenarios, please visit [Proposal](proposal.md).
